# data-structures-cpp

[This wiki](https://github.com/alichtman/data-structures-cpp/wiki) is designed to make data structures a more accessible topic to computer science students. **The goal is to explain all of the data structures content in an easily understood manner.**

It's based largely off a course review guide I wrote while taking CS225 at UIUC in Fall 2017, but I'm in the process of updating it to be less of "Aaron's Notes" and more of an "absolute guide to data structures."

**Contributions are always welcome!**
