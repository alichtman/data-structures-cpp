# data-structures-cpp

[This wiki](https://github.com/alichtman/data-structures-cpp/wiki) is designed to help programmers learn about data structures in `C++`.

It's based largely off a course review guide I wrote while taking CS225 at UIUC in Fall 2017.

It covers most of the course content in detail, but there are bits and pieces missing.

**Contributions are always welcome!**

Just open an Issue or a Pull Request.
